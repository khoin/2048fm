2048b FM
=====

## What is this?
This is a FM (PM) synthesizer that runs in your web browser. Its file size is 2048bytes (index.html). You can check out the commented source in uncompressed.html.

## Features

* 6 Operators
* ADS (Attack, Decay, Sustain) Envelope
* Theoretical 32-voice polyphony (on my computer, no keyboard events fired after holding down 6 keys)
* Arbitrary operator routing. Any operators can route to any other operators, even self. They can be carriers and/or modulators. 
* Saving and loading patches
* C4-A5 keyboard (corresponding to 2 top rows on your keyboard, Q to backslash).

## Components

* Bitmap font 0-9ADSICTO at 160 bytes + 59 bytes (for pixel drawing)
* Bresenham line drawing at 159 bytes + 59 bytes (for pixel drawing)
* DSP + keyboard mapping is at 668 bytes
* The rest: GUI, mouse, patch save/load 754 bytes

## Caveats

* It is not possible for modulators (that does not go directly to output) to be silent. I did this so that we can skip calculations if an operator have zero volume.
* No release envelope stage :c
* No fixed frequency mode. 
* It is not a DX7 emulator :c I first wanted it to be one.
* On my machine, if you don't have any modulation, it doesn't lag. But if you do, it usually lags out at 3-4 voices.
